"We told her," said the ducks. "We were flying inland--there's a pretty
bad storm over the Irish Sea, and it's headed this way--and we saw you
landing out of the snail's shell. We dropped down at the house to let
her know the news. We were awfully glad to see you back. And she asked
would we return and bring you a message--she herself was busy airing
the bed linen, it seems. She says you're to stop in at the butcher's on
the way home and bring along a pound of sausages. Also she's short of
sugar, she says, and needs a few more candles, too."
